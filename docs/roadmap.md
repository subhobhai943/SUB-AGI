# SUB-AGI Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally ambitious but structured in small, testable steps.

## Phase 0 – Foundation
- Set up repository structure (`docs/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
- Decide on primary implementation language (initially Python).
- Create contribution guidelines and coding standards.

## Phase 1 – Mind Kernel Prototype
- Implement a minimal **Mind Kernel** that runs as a loop:
  - Receives input.
  - Updates internal state.
  - Produces output or internal thoughts.
- Implement basic working memory and a tiny episodic memory.
- Expose debugging tools to inspect internal state after each step.

## Phase 2 – Alphabet Learning (A–Z)
- Design a curriculum for teaching SUB-AGI the English alphabet:
  - Recognize each letter.
  - Produce each letter.
  - Associate letters with simple concepts or images later.
- Track how it learns over time (learning curves, error patterns).

## Phase 3 – Toddler-Level Interaction
- Enable:
  - Simple question-answer dialogues.
  - Self-referential statements ("My name is SUB-AGI").
  - Memory of recent interactions ("You told me this before").
- Introduce simple preferences and curiosity-driven exploration.

## Phase 4 – Research-Grade Experiments
- Run controlled experiments to compare SUB-AGI's learning patterns with human toddlers (using developmental psychology benchmarks).
- Publish findings and designs in open-access venues.

## Phase 5 – Beyond Text-Only
- Explore adding simple simulated sensory inputs (shapes, colors, simple environments).
- Study how multi-modal learning changes internal representations.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated frequently as we learn what is realistic and what needs to change.
