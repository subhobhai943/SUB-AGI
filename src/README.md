Core implementation for SUB-AGI will live here.

- `mind_kernel/` – main control loop, internal state, and interfaces.
- `memory/` – episodic, semantic, and procedural memory modules.
- `io/` – text input/output adapters, later extended to other modalities.
- `experiments/` – training scripts, evaluation protocols, and analysis tools.

Folders will be created as modules are implemented.
